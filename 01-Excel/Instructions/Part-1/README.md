# Part 1: Excel Mini-Cases

Review the Instructions for the Golfing Targets, Game Sales, Filter Game Sales, and NBA Stats exercises.

Follow the Instructions in the `README.md` file for each subfolder and use the provided worksheets to code your solution.

Organize the solutions in a folder structure as follows:
* HW_Task1_GolfingTargets
* HW_Task2_GameSales
* HW_Task3_FilterGameSales
* HW_Task4_NBAStats

Solve all four cases and upload the solutions to your GitHub repo.

### Task 1: Golfing Targets

What better way to express moving averages than with a data set that is all about calculating the average accuracy of a golfer? We had 5 golfers take 20 shots onto a green and calculated the distance to the hole. It is up to you to find the moving averages of their shots using different intervals.

#### Instructions

Use the starter workbook in the  HW_Task1_GolfingTargets folder.

1. Using a moving average with an interval of 2, find the average shot accuracy for each subject. Then create a 2D line graph that charts these values.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - Paint, Microsoft Word, etc. - before moving onto making the next chart.

2. Using a moving average with an interval of 4, find the average shot accuracy for each subject. Then create a 2D line graph that charts these values.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - Paint, Microsoft Word, etc. - before moving onto making the next chart.

### Task 2: Game Sales

Use the starter workbook in the  HW_Task2_GameSales folder.

Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, you will pair up with one of your classmates in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

#### Instructions

1. Create a scatter plot that compares the NA (North American) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

2. Create a scatter plot that compares the EU (European) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

3. Create a scatter plot that compares the JP (Japanese) sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

4. Create a scatter plot that compares other sales of games versus the global sales of games. Make sure to add in axis titles, a chart title, and a trend line.

5. Go back into each of your charts and modify the axes so that they are consistent for each chart.

* Without consistency of margins between your charts they could be considered misleading.

### Task 3: Filtering Game Sales

The task is to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets. Then create charts which compare the sales of publishers against one another.

#### Instructions

1. Create a scatter plot which graphs the critical response (Critic Score) of games published by Nintendo as compared to their global sales.

* Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

* Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - paint, Microsoft Word, etc - before moving onto making the next chart.

2. Create a scatter plot which graphs the critical response of games published by Electronic Arts as compared to their global sales.

* Only chart those games that have been reviewed. Games without any reviews should be ignored.

* Add a chart title, axis titles, and a trend line to the graph that is created.

* Copy your chart and paste it into an external program - paint, Microsoft Word, etc - before moving onto making the next chart.

3. Select all of the data on the worksheet and create a line chart which can be filtered by publisher, whose rows are set by a game's year of release, and whose values are the sum of global sales for that year.

* Create a 2D line graph that charts this data.

### Task 4: Regression in the NBA

Use the starter workbook in the  HW_Task3_NBAStats folder.

Your turn to run a regression analysis on the 2017 NBA Season.

#### Instructions

* Run a regression analysis on the 2017 NBA season stats.

* You will use `PTS` (points) as your Y variable, or dependent variable.

* You will determine which X variables, or independent variables, to use.

* After you have run regression, explain why your choice was or was not a good choice.

  * Do the results have a good `R Square` value?

  * Is your choice statistically reliable?

  * Explain what your coefficients mean.

* Finally produce a scatter plot and explain your overall analysis.
